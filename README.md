This is my assessment for Vaimo

Inside this folder you will find an assets.zip file. Please unzip this file and place the contents in the root folder

____Compiling and Running_____
Simply open main.html and the content of this webpage will be shown

_____Architecture_____
The architechture is quite simple: Your standard HTML + CSS + Javascript while also importing JQuery as a cdn in the html file

_____Why this technology stack?_____
I am most used to coding in these main web application languages but I am able to branch out if need be.
Another reason I chose these 3 is to show you what I can do with the base minimum languages for a simple website.
HTML: Simple, basic, necessary to display and organize information
CSS: Alters the HTML coding to display as required
Javascript: A necessary tool to load the API and determine the information in the backend
JQuery: Makes using javascript easier and a lot more shorthand.
